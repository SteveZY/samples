 * DP based:
 * Given a startPoint and endPoint on number line (1,2,3...10) and list of hurdles [1, 4],
 * you can jump two steps forward and one step backward -> [2 to 4, or 2 to 1]
 * and you cannot jump if there is hurdle,
 * You can't go beyond start and end points on the number line.
 * Count the number of ways you can reach the endPoint. (you always start from startPoint)
 *
 *
 * 1) startPoint and endPoint are not hurdle
 * 2) If endPoint is not reachable return -1.
 * 3) 1 <= number of line < 1000
